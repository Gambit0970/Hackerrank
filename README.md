# Hackerrank submissions
These were created from my Hackerrank account


To use the main.py file to scrape hackerranks:
  * download the code
  * run command line as follows: python main.py uuuuuuuu pppppppp
    where
    * uuuuuuuu is your hackerrank username
    * pppppppp is your hackerrank password

 * Submissions folder in the following structure:
   *     "cpp"  folder - *."cpp"
   *     "py"   folder - *.python, *.python3, *.pypy, *.pypy3
   *     "bash" folder - *.sh
