# Hackerrank submissions
These were created from my Hackerrank account


To use the main.py file to scrape hackerranks:
  * download the code
  * run command line as follows: python main.py uuuuuuuu pppppppp
    where
    * uuuuuuuu is your hackerrank username
    * pppppppp is your hackerrank password

 * see the submissions folder for structure

Credit to @0xecho for the original code
